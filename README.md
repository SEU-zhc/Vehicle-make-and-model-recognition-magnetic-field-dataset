## Vehicle make and model recognition magnetic field dataset

### 1.description

In order to promote the research of vehicle model identification based on magnetic field data, we use the RM3100 magnetic field sensor to collect the data set of the vehicle when passing through the magnetic field sensor. Features of the dataset include:

(1) vehicle speed from 10-50 km / hh</br>
(2) Data includes the make and model of the vehicle</br>
(3) The dataset includes 40 different vehicles with 100 samples per vehicle</br>
(4) Samples have been segmented and labeled using the finite state automata method
(5) The data format is as follows:</br>
> Hardware address, time, linear acceleration, rotational angular velocity, spatial attitude, temperature, magnetic field data</br>
